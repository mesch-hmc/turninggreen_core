    <h1>ECONOMICS</h1>
    <p>The economy relies heavily on natural capital assets, yet all too often the economy is still seen
      as separate from the environment. There is also a common misconception that opting for green products
      is more expensive than conventional shopping. However, investing in zero waste reusable staples,
      shopping second hand and stocking up at the farmer’s market are actually much more affordable than
      their conventional counterparts.

                How can you live sustainably within your budget in a way that allows for the earth and its
                species to thrive? Consuming less “stuff” and voting with your dollar are good places to start!
                While actions like stopping for a coffee are seemingly inexpensive on a day-to-day basis, these
                costs really add up in the long run. Start off by keeping track of all your expenses for the
                duration of this challenge. Be careful not to let the fact that you're tracking your expenses
                influence the way you shop; this audit needs to reflect how you actually spend your money. At the
                end of the challenge duration, assess your spending habits. What were unnecessary purchases?
                Could any of your purchases be eliminated without decreasing your quality of life? How much time
                and money could skipping these purchases save you?
