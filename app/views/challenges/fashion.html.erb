    <h1>FASHION</h1>
    <p>
      Your personal style is an expression of who you are, and your core values. Have you considered
      how your favorite fashion brands align with your social and political views? The $3 trillion
      fashion industry is the second most polluting, just behind oil. Did you know there are companies out
      there revolutionizing textile manufacturing to decrease natural resource use?

                Look at the shirt you're wearing. Check the tag inside the shirt. What kind of information
                does it provide (aside from cleaning instructions)? Note the brand name, materials used,
                and where it was produced. Research the impact this item may have had on the people who
                produced it and the environment. Be bold and wear your shirt inside out for the day to give
                the small-tag details the attention they deserve. Whenever someone says your shirt is inside out,
                teach them something you learned about the fashion industry from your research.
